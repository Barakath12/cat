            "Just like human fingerprints, each cat's nose print is unique and can be used to identify them.",
            "Cats sleep for about 12-16 hours a day, making them one of the sleepiest animals. They are crepuscular, meaning they are most active during dawn and dusk.",
            "Cats have a wide range of vocalizations, including meows, purrs, hisses, and growls, which they use to communicate with humans and other cats.",
            "Domestic cats are natural hunters and can run up to 30 miles per hour in short bursts when chasing prey.",
            "Cats were domesticated around 9,000 years ago in the Near East, primarily for their ability to control rodent populations.",
            "A cat's tail position can indicate its mood; for example, a raised tail often signifies happiness, while a puffed-up tail indicates fear or aggression.",
            "Cats spend a significant portion of their day grooming themselves, which helps them regulate body temperature and keep their fur clean.",
            "Indoor cats typically live longer than outdoor cats, with an average lifespan of 12-15 years, while some can live into their 20s with proper care."
